### Hi there, I'm Stefan.

I'm a Software Engineer with focus on C#/.NET.
This is my techstack:
- .NET6, ASP.NET
- EF, LINQ
- Blazor, WPF, WinForms
- log4net, Serilog
- PostgreSQL, MSSQL
- IIS, Docker
- HTML, JS

I'm also familiar with C++ and C, where I worked with microchips and automotive software, but I love the way C# goes.


I studied Technical Computer Science (B.Sc.) and started with my first full time job in 2018.
My actual goal is to reach my Senior level.
